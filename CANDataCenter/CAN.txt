Volume: Byte[2] is ones, baseline is 0x30 Byte[1] is tens, baseline is 0x20 then 0x31 when over 10
e.g. volume 5 is 0x20 0x35, volume 11 is 0x31 0x31, volume 36 is 0x33 0x36
i'm a dummy this is the display

however you could still use this to detect volume :)
..VOL..13...
Note: display is only 12 chars, not 14

0x28F showing activity on byte[3] when seeking
Seems to show last control? Value is 0x38 when seeking with wheel or stereo, then 0x00 when adjusting volume on either
Goes back to 0x38 5 seconds after adjusting volume
Ok this is just something with the display - not sure what though
Maybe tells stereo when to go back to showing song info?
